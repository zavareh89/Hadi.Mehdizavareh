    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am profoundly passionate about machine learning and data science. Regardless of the specific 
      topic I am engaged in, I derive immense joy from manipulating data, extracting insights, and 
      formulating innovative ideas or methodologies to address real-world challenges. My professional 
      vision is to leverage my problem-solving skills to confront issues of global significance. 
      Making a modest impact on such problems is tremendously valuable. 
      This perspective motivated my choice of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) as the focus of my 
      master's thesis and my aspiration to establish my own company.

      Over the past six years, I have immersed myself in various machine-learning subdomains, working 
      with diverse datasets. These include predicting stock prices using time-series data, analyzing 
      structured data, implementing speech recognition, processing images, analyzing medical images, 
      developing recommendation systems, delving into EEG signal analysis and algorithms utilized in 
      BCIs, and exploring learning-based hashing methods for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANN) tasks.

      I am presently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at Aalborg University under the guidance of Professor 
      Arijit Khan. My research involves the analysis of electronic health record (EHR) data, with a focus on 
      developing learning-based biomedical algorithms within intensive care unit (ICU) settings. The objective 
      is to predict blood glucose levels for inpatients, aiming to assist clinicians in their decision-making 
      processes and enhance the overall quality of life for patients.

          I worked on EEG signal decoding algorithms and their usage in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) 
          for my master's thesis. The application I worked on was the speller BCI based on steady-state 
          visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs).

          My co-founder and I were building a social app for movie and TV recommendations. Some parts of the 
          project were implemented. Unfortunately, it failed for many reasons :). During this journey, 
          however, I learned many skills including but not limited to backend development, marketing techniques, 
          how to work with APIs, and finding the simplest (and not necessarily the best) solutions. 
          The most important lesson for me was the point that perfectionism is very dangerous and fatal for any startup.
