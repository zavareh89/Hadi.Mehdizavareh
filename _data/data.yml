    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am profoundly passionate about machine learning and data science. Regardless of the specific 
      topic I am engaged in, I derive immense joy from manipulating data, extracting insights, and 
      formulating innovative ideas or methodologies to address real-world challenges. My professional 
      vision is to leverage my problem-solving skills to confront issues of global significance. 
      Making a modest impact on such problems is tremendously valuable. 
      This perspective motivated my choice of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) as the focus of my 
      master's thesis and my aspiration to establish my own company.

      Over the past six years, I have immersed myself in various machine-learning subdomains, working 
      with diverse datasets. These include predicting stock prices using time-series data, analyzing 
      structured data, implementing speech recognition, processing images, analyzing medical images, 
      developing recommendation systems, delving into EEG signal analysis and algorithms utilized in 
      BCIs, and exploring learning-based hashing methods for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANN) tasks.

      I am presently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at Aalborg University under the guidance of Professor 
      Arijit Khan. My research involves the analysis of electronic health record (EHR) data, with a focus on 
      developing learning-based biomedical algorithms within intensive care unit (ICU) settings. The objective 
      is to predict blood glucose levels for inpatients, aiming to assist clinicians in their decision-making 
      processes and enhance the overall quality of life for patients.

          I worked on EEG signal decoding algorithms and their usage in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) 
          for my master's thesis. The application I worked on was the speller BCI based on steady-state 
          visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs).
